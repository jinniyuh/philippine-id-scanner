cd /path/to/capstone
cp config.env.example.php config.env.php
nano config.env.php  # Edit with live credentials
chmod 600 config.env.php
```

**2. Set Permissions:**
```bash
chmod 755 includes/
chmod 755 assets/
chmod 777 uploads/
chmod 755 *.php
```

**3. Verify .htaccess Working:**
```bash
# Test includes protection
curl https://yoursite.com/includes/conn.php
# Should return: 403 Forbidden ✅

# Test uploads protection

## 🎓 WHAT EACH SECURITY FILE DOES

### **config.env.php** (NOT in Git)
```
Stores: Database credentials securely
Protects: Prevents password exposure
Usage: Required on live server
```

### **config.env.example.php** (In Git)
```
Purpose: Template for deployment
Usage: Copy and customize for each environment
```

### **.gitignore**
```
Protects: config.env.php, uploads/, logs/
Prevents: Sensitive data in Git
```

### **includes/csrf.php**
```
Provides: CSRF token generation and validation
Prevents: Cross-site request forgery attacks
Usage: Include in forms (optional for now)
```

### **includes/security.php**
```
Provides: Rate limiting, security functions
Features: Brute force protection, sanitization
Usage: Included in login.php
```

### **.htaccess files**
```
includes/.htaccess: Blocks direct access
uploads/.htaccess: Prevents PHP execution
Root .htaccess: Security headers
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **For Localhost:**
```
✓ Works as before
✓ Uses vetvet database
✓ config.env.php not needed locally
✓ Session secure flags adapt to HTTP
```

### **For Live Server:**
```
✓ Auto-detects it's live
✓ Loads from config.env.php
✓ Uses live database
⚠️ MUST create config.env.php on server!
```

### **If config.env.php Missing on Live:**
```
Shows: "SECURITY ERROR: Configuration file missing!"
Action: Create config.env.php from template
```

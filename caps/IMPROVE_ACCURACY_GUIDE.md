## Critical Success Factors

### 1. ⏰ TIME (Most Important!)
**Minimum Required**: 12 months of historical data
**Recommended**: 24+ months

**Current Status**: Check `check_data_quality.php`

**Actions**:
- ✅ Continue collecting data every month
- ✅ Import historical data if available
- ✅ Be patient - accuracy improves with time

**Expected Improvement**:
- 6 months data → ~50-60% accuracy
- 12 months data → ~70-80% accuracy  
- 24+ months data → ~80-95% accuracy

---

### 2. 📊 CONSISTENCY
**Goal**: Similar transaction volumes each month

**Check For**:
- ❌ Months with zero or very few transactions
- ❌ Huge spikes in certain months
- ❌ Long gaps in data collection

**Actions**:
```sql
-- Check monthly transaction distribution
SELECT 
    DATE_FORMAT(request_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    COUNT(*) as transactions
FROM transactions
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month DESC;
```

**Fix Issues**:
- Ensure regular, consistent data entry
- Investigate and document unusual months
- Avoid batch-entering backdated transactions

---

### 3. 📈 VOLUME
**Minimum**: 50 total transactions
**Good**: 200+ transactions
**Excellent**: 500+ transactions

**Current Status**: Check `check_data_quality.php`

**Actions**:
- Record ALL pharmaceutical requests
- Track ALL livestock/poultry registrations
- Encourage clients to request through the system

---

### 4. 🎯 DATA QUALITY

#### A. Accurate Entry
- ✅ Double-check quantities before saving
- ✅ Verify dates are correct
- ✅ Ensure pharmaceutical IDs match correctly

#### B. Complete Records
- ✅ Fill all required fields
- ✅ Don't leave blank dates or quantities
- ✅ Update livestock counts regularly

#### C. Clean Data
```sql
-- Find potential duplicates
SELECT pharma_id, request_date, quantity, COUNT(*) as count
FROM transactions
GROUP BY pharma_id, request_date, quantity
HAVING count > 1;
```

## 🔧 Model Tuning (Advanced)

### Current ARIMA Parameters
**Default**: ARIMA(1,1,1)
- p=1: Uses 1 previous time point
- d=1: First-order differencing
- q=1: Moving average of 1 period

### When You Have 12+ Months of Data

#### Test Different Parameters
Edit `includes/arima_forecaster.php`:

```php
// For seasonal data (e.g., breeding seasons)
$arima = new ARIMAForecaster($data, 2, 1, 2);

// For stable, consistent data
$arima = new ARIMAForecaster($data, 1, 0, 1);

// For highly variable data
$arima = new ARIMAForecaster($data, 3, 1, 3);
```

#### Parameter Guidelines
- **p (AutoRegressive)**: 1-3 (how many previous values to use)
- **d (Differencing)**: 0-2 (1 for most cases)
- **q (Moving Average)**: 1-3 (smoothing parameter)

## 📊 Expected Accuracy by Data Quality

| Data Quality Score | Expected Accuracy | What It Means |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| 80-100 | 80-95% | Excellent - Reliable forecasts |
| 60-79  | 70-85% | Good - Useful for planning |
| 40-59  | 50-70% | Fair - General trends only |
| 0-39   | 30-50% | Poor - Not reliable yet |

## 🚦 Monthly Checklist for High Accuracy

### Every Month:
- [ ] Enter all transactions promptly
- [ ] Update livestock/poultry counts
- [ ] Review data for errors or anomalies
- [ ] Check forecast accuracy on ML Insights page

### Every Quarter:
- [ ] Run `check_data_quality.php`
- [ ] Review and clean any duplicate entries
- [ ] Analyze forecast vs actual performance
- [ ] Adjust data collection processes if needed

### Every 6 Months:
- [ ] Review ARIMA parameter performance
- [ ] Consider adjusting p, d, q values
- [ ] Export and backup all data
- [ ] Generate comprehensive reports

## 💡 Pro Tips for 90%+ Accuracy

1. **Consistency Beats Volume**
   - 12 months of consistent data > 24 months of sporadic data

2. **Recent Data Matters More**
   - Most recent 6-12 months have highest impact
   - Keep current data very accurate

3. **Seasonal Patterns**
   - If you notice seasonal patterns (e.g., rainy season demand)
   - Consider implementing SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA)
   - Document seasonal events

4. **Category-Specific Forecasts**
   - Forecast by pharmaceutical category, not just overall
   - Different categories may have different patterns
   - Already implemented in system!

5. **Regular Validation**
   - The system validates using last 3 months
   - This shows real accuracy, not theoretical
   - Monitor this metric monthly

## 🎓 Understanding Your Accuracy Metrics

### What the System Shows:
- **Accuracy Percentage**: How close predictions are to reality
- **85% accuracy** = predictions within 15% of actual values
- **Higher is better**

### Interpretation:
- **90%+**: Excellent - Trust these forecasts for critical decisions
- **80-89%**: Very Good - Reliable for planning and budgeting
- **70-79%**: Good - Useful for general trends
- **60-69%**: Fair - Use with caution, general guidance only
- **<60%**: Poor - Need more/better data before relying on forecasts

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: How long until I get good accuracy?
**A**: With consistent data entry:
- Month 6: Fair accuracy (60-70%)
- Month 12: Good accuracy (70-80%)
- Month 24: Excellent accuracy (80-90%+)

### Q: My accuracy is low, what's wrong?
**A**: Most common causes:
1. Less than 12 months of data
2. Inconsistent monthly entries
3. Data quality issues (duplicates, errors)
4. Unusual events not accounted for

Run `check_data_quality.php` for specific diagnosis!

### Q: Can I improve accuracy faster?
**A**: 
- Import historical data if available
- Ensure consistent, accurate daily entry

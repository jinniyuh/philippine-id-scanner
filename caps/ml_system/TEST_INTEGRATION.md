# ML System Integration Test

## ✅ Integration Complete!

All machine learning files have been organized and integrated with Flask API.

---

## 📋 What Was Done

### 1. ✅ Organized ML Files

All ML files moved to `ml_system/` folder with proper structure:

```
ml_system/
├── api/                    # Flask API & connectors
├── scripts/                # ML Python scripts
├── models/                 # ML models
└── docs/                   # Documentation
```

### 2. ✅ Added Flask API

Created comprehensive Flask REST API:
- `ml_system/api/ml_flask_api.py` (950+ lines)
- Forecasting endpoints
- Health risk prediction endpoints
- Database integration
- Auto-fallback system

### 3. ✅ Health Risk ML Integration

Integrated ML with health risk monitoring:
- Updated `includes/ml_health_risk_assessor.php`
- Added Flask API support
- Fixed script paths to use `ml_system/scripts/`
- Created health risk API connectors
- Automatic 3-layer fallback (Flask → Python CLI → Rule-based)

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Step 1: Start Flask Server

**Windows:**
```cmd
cd c:\xampp\htdocs\capstone\ml_system
start_flask.bat
```

**Expected Output:**
```
============================================================
ML Flask API Server
============================================================
Starting server on http://localhost:5000
...
* Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000
```

✅ **Test:** Open http://localhost:5000 - should see API info

---

### Step 2: Test General ML Insights

**URL:** http://localhost/capstone/ml_system/api/test_flask_api.php

**Tests to run:**
1. ✅ Click "Check Flask Server" - should show "Online"
2. ✅ Click "Get API Info" - should show version 1.0.0
3. ✅ Click "Get Full ML Insights" - should generate forecasts
4. ✅ Click "Run Forecast Test" - should predict demand
5. ✅ Click "Run All Tests" - all should pass

**Expected Results:**
- All tests return `success: true`
- Forecasts generated for pharmaceutical, livestock, poultry
- Response time < 5 seconds

---

### Step 3: Test Health Risk Prediction

**URL:** http://localhost/capstone/ml_system/api/test_health_risk_api.php

**Tests to run:**
1. ✅ Click "Check Server" - Flask should be online
2. ✅ Click "Predict Health Risk" - should predict risk level
3. ✅ Enter valid animal ID and click "Assess Animal"
4. ✅ Click "Run All Health Risk Tests"

**Expected Results:**
- Risk level: Low/Medium/High/Critical
- Risk score: 0-100
- Confidence: percentage
- Recommendations: list of actions

---

### Step 4: Test Admin Dashboard Integration

**URL:** http://localhost/capstone/admin_ml_insights.php

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Login as admin
2. ✅ Page should load ML insights automatically
3. ✅ Select medicine from dropdown - forecast should generate
4. ✅ Select livestock species - forecast should generate
5. ✅ Select poultry species - forecast should generate
6. ✅ Check browser console - should see "Loading ML insights..."

**Expected Results:**
- Pharmaceutical demand forecast displays
- Livestock population forecast displays
- Poultry population forecast displays
- Charts render properly
- No JavaScript errors

---

### Step 5: Test Health Risk Monitoring

**URL:** http://localhost/capstone/admin_health_risk_monitoring.php

**Tests:**
1. ✅ Login as admin
2. ✅ Page loads with risk summary cards
3. ✅ Click "Assess" button on any animal
4. ✅ Assessment should complete with ML prediction
5. ✅ Check if "ml_enhanced: true" in results

**Expected Results:**
- Risk assessments generate
- Risk levels shown (Low/Medium/High/Critical)
- Recommendations appear
- ML-enhanced badge/indicator visible

---

### Step 6: Test Fallback System

**Test Flask Fallback:**

1. Stop Flask server (Ctrl+C)
2. Go to admin_ml_insights.php
3. Page should still work (using PHP fallback)
4. Browser console should show "falling back to PHP"

**Test Python CLI:**

1. Keep Flask stopped
2. Go to admin_health_risk_monitoring.php
3. Click "Assess" on animal
4. Should use Python CLI script
5. Check PHP error logs for "Using Python CLI"

## 🚨 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'flask'"

**Solution:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "Port 5000 already in use"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :5000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Or change port in ml_flask_api.py
app.run(port=5001)
```

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

**Solution:**
1. Check MySQL is running
2. Verify credentials in `includes/conn.php`
3. Test: `mysql -u root -p bagovets`

### Issue: "ML models not found"

**Solution:**
- This is normal if models aren't trained yet
- System will use rule-based fallback
- Models are optional but improve accuracy

### Issue: Assessment returns "error"

**Check:**
1. Animal ID exists in database
2. Flask server is running
3. Python is installed
4. Check PHP error logs

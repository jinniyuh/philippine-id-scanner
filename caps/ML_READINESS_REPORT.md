## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### **1. Pharmaceutical Forecast Accuracy: Low**
```
Issue: Data too variable (26 to 686 per month)
Impact: ARIMA can't predict well
Current: ~0% accuracy (filtered out)

Fix Options:
a) More consistent data entry
b) Use different algorithm (Moving Average)
c) Accept limitation and focus on trends

Ready? YES, but accuracy will improve with better data
```

### **2. Species-Specific Data Gaps**
```
Issue: Some species have little data
Impact: Those species show "N/A" accuracy

Examples:
✅ Swine: 71.1% accuracy (good!)
❌ Turkey: N/A (not enough records)
❌ Goose: N/A (not enough records)

Ready? YES, works for species with data
```

### **3. Flask API Optional**
```
Issue: Flask server might not run on shared hosting
Impact: Falls back to PHP (still works!)

Workaround: PHP-based forecasting ✅
Ready? YES, doesn't require Flask
```

# 🏥 How Health Risk Monitoring Works - Complete Explanation

## 📋 Overview

The **Health Risk Monitoring System** uses **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict which animals are at risk of getting sick, allowing you to take preventive action BEFORE problems occur.

---

## 🎯 What It Does (In Simple Terms)

**Think of it like a health check-up for animals that predicts future problems:**

1. **Monitors** all animals in the system
2. **Analyzes** their health data, symptoms, and environment
3. **Predicts** which animals might get sick
4. **Alerts** you about high-risk animals
5. **Recommends** specific actions to prevent disease

---

## 🔄 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### **Step 1: Data Collection** 📊

The system collects data from multiple sources:

#### A. **Animal Information**
```
- Animal ID
- Species (Cattle, Swine, Chicken, etc.)
- Age (calculated from birth date)
- Current health status (Healthy, Sick, Under Treatment)
- Owner information
- Location (Barangay)
```

#### B. **Health Indicators** (Tracked over time)
```
- Weight measurements
- Temperature readings
- Vaccination status
- Behavioral changes
- Symptoms reported
```

#### C. **Environmental Factors**
```
- Housing conditions (Good, Fair, Poor)
- Season (Dry/Wet)
- Location
- Population density
```

#### D. **Historical Data**
```
- Previous health assessments
- Past illnesses
- Treatment history
- Symptom patterns
```

---

### **Step 2: Risk Assessment Algorithm** 🤖

The system uses a **multi-layered approach** to calculate risk:

#### **Layer 1: Base Risk Score (0-40 points)**

**Health Status:**
- Healthy → 0 points
- Sick → +30 points
- Under Treatment → +20 points

**Age Factor:**
- Very young (<6 months) → +5 points
- Very old (>7 years) → +5 points
- Normal age → 0 points

**Vaccination:**
- Up to date → 0 points
- Overdue → +10 points
- Never vaccinated → +15 points

---

#### **Layer 2: Symptom Analysis (0-50 points)**

**Critical Symptoms (40-50 points each):**
```
🔴 CRITICAL:
- Sudden death nearby
- Difficulty breathing
- Convulsions/seizures
- Bloody diarrhea
- Bloody vomiting
- Paralysis

🟡 HIGH (25-35 points):
- High fever (>40°C)
- Severe weakness/lethargy
- Skin redness/spots
- Loss of appetite

🟢 MEDIUM (10-20 points):
- Mild fever
- Coughing/sneezing
- Nasal discharge
- Mild diarrhea
```

**Example:**
```
Animal with "difficulty breathing" + "high fever" = 40 + 25 = 65 points
→ HIGH RISK
```

---

#### **Layer 3: Seasonal Adjustments (×1.0 to ×1.5)**

**Philippine Seasons:**

**Dry Season (Dec-May):**
- Normal risk multiplier: ×1.0

**Wet Season (Jun-Nov):**
- Higher disease risk: ×1.2 to ×1.5
- More parasites, bacteria thrive
- Respiratory diseases increase

**Example:**
```
Base risk: 40 points
Wet season: ×1.3
Adjusted risk: 40 × 1.3 = 52 points
```

---

#### **Layer 4: Environmental Risk (0-20 points)**

**Housing Conditions:**
```
Good environment → 0 points
Fair environment → +10 points
Poor environment → +20 points
```

**Population Density:**
```
High density → +10 points (disease spreads faster)
Low density → 0 points
```

---

#### **Layer 5: Historical Pattern Analysis**

**Learning from the past:**
```
- Has this animal been sick before? → +10 points
- Similar symptoms in the past? → +15 points
- Recurring health issues? → +20 points
- Other animals nearby got sick? → +15 points
```

---

### **Step 3: Final Risk Score Calculation** 🎯

**Formula:**
```
Final Score = (Base Risk + Symptoms + Environmental) × Seasonal × Historical Pattern

Then capped at 0-100
```

**Example Calculation:**

```
Animal: "Baboy" (Pig), Age: 8 months, Barangay: Sampinit

Base Risk:
- Health Status: Sick → 30 points
- Age: Normal → 0 points
- Vaccination: Overdue → 10 points
Total Base: 40 points

Symptoms:
- High fever → 25 points
- Loss of appetite → 15 points
Total Symptoms: 40 points

Environmental:
- Poor housing → 20 points

Seasonal (October = Wet Season):
- Multiplier: ×1.3

Historical:
- Was sick 3 months ago → +10 points

CALCULATION:
(40 + 40 + 20) × 1.3 + 10 = 140 (capped at 100)

FINAL SCORE: 100 points
RISK LEVEL: CRITICAL ⚠️
```

---

### **Step 4: Risk Level Classification** 🚦

**Based on final score:**

```
🟢 LOW RISK (0-39 points):
   "Animal is healthy, low concern"
   → Continue routine monitoring

🟡 MEDIUM RISK (40-59 points):
   "Animal needs attention soon"
   → Schedule health check within 1 week

🟠 HIGH RISK (60-79 points):
   "Animal needs immediate attention"
   → Veterinary consultation within 24 hours

🔴 CRITICAL RISK (80-100 points):
   "Emergency - Immediate action required!"
   → Immediate veterinary examination
   → Possible isolation
   → Emergency protocols
```

---

### **Step 5: Recommendations Generation** 💡

**The system automatically generates specific recommendations:**

#### **For CRITICAL Risk:**
```
✅ Immediate Actions:
   1. Contact veterinarian immediately
   2. Isolate animal if showing contagious signs
   3. Monitor vital signs every 6 hours
   4. Prepare emergency treatment supplies
   5. Notify owner immediately
```

#### **For HIGH Risk:**
```
✅ Urgent Actions:
   1. Schedule vet consultation within 24 hours
   2. Increase monitoring frequency (every 12 hours)
   3. Review and improve housing conditions
   4. Implement preventive measures
   5. Check other animals for similar symptoms
```

#### **For MEDIUM Risk:**
```
✅ Routine Actions:
   1. Schedule health check within 1 week
   2. Monitor for changes in behavior/condition
   3. Review vaccination schedule
   4. Maintain current health protocols
```

#### **For LOW Risk:**
```
✅ Preventive Actions:
   1. Continue routine monitoring
   2. Regular health checkups as scheduled
   3. Maintain good nutrition and housing
   4. Keep vaccinations up to date
```

## 🎯 Real-World Example

### **Scenario:**

**Farmer Juan reports his pig "Baboy1" is not eating well**

#### **What Happens:**

**Step 1: Data Entry**
```
Client submits pharmaceutical request:
- Animal: Baboy1
- Symptoms: "Loss of appetite, mild fever"
```

**Step 2: System Collects Data**
```
Animal Info:
- Type: Swine
- Age: 6 months
- Health Status: Healthy → Changed to Sick
- Vaccination: Up to date
- Location: Barangay Sampinit

Health Indicators (Recent):
- Weight: 45 kg (last week)
- Temperature: None recent
- Behavioral change: Loss of appetite

Environmental:
- Housing: Fair condition
- Season: October (Wet Season)
```

**Step 3: Risk Calculation**
```
Base Risk:
- Health Status (Sick): +30
- Vaccination (OK): +0
- Age (Normal): +0
= 30 points

Symptoms:
- Loss of appetite: +15
- Mild fever: +15
= 30 points

Environmental:
- Fair housing: +10
- Wet season multiplier: ×1.3

Historical:
- No previous illness: +0

CALCULATION:
(30 + 30 + 10) × 1.3 = 91 → Capped at 100

FINAL: 91 points → CRITICAL RISK
```

**Step 4: Alert Generated**
```
🔴 CRITICAL ALERT:
Animal: Baboy1
Risk Score: 91/100
Risk Level: Critical

Risk Factors:
- Current illness detected
- Loss of appetite reported
- Mild fever symptoms
- Wet season increases disease risk
- Fair housing conditions

Recommendations:
1. ⚠️ IMMEDIATE: Contact veterinarian
2. Monitor temperature every 6 hours
3. Isolate from other pigs
4. Check other pigs for similar symptoms
5. Prepare for possible ASF/Classical Swine Fever
6. Improve housing ventilation
```

**Step 5: Admin Sees Alert**
```
Dashboard shows:
- New critical alert notification
- Baboy1 appears in "High Risk Animals" list
- Red badge on Health Risk Monitoring page
```

**Step 6: Action Taken**
```
Admin:
- Calls Farmer Juan
- Schedules immediate vet visit
- Checks other pigs in Sampinit
- Updates pharmaceutical inventory
```

**Step 7: Follow-up**
```
After treatment:
- Admin records treatment
- System reassesses risk (now: Low)
- Tracks recovery progress
- Learns from this case for future predictions
```

## 🔍 Symptom Detection System

### **How Symptoms Are Detected:**

#### **Method 1: Pharmaceutical Request Forms**
When clients request medicine, they describe symptoms:
```
Form Field: "What symptoms is the animal showing?"
Client enters: "Ubo, lagnat, walang gana kumain"
                (Cough, fever, loss of appetite)

System detects:
✓ Cough → +15 risk points
✓ Fever → +20 risk points  
✓ Loss of appetite → +15 risk points
Total: +50 points
```

#### **Method 2: Health Indicator Logging**
Staff/admin can log specific health indicators:
```
Indicator Type: Temperature
Value: 40.5°C
Date: 2025-10-14

System analyzes:
Normal pig temp: 38-39.5°C
Current: 40.5°C → High fever!
Risk: +25 points
```

#### **Method 3: Pattern Recognition**
System looks for patterns:
```
Multiple animals in same barangay with similar symptoms:
- Pig 1: Fever, loss of appetite
- Pig 2: Fever, weakness
- Pig 3: Fever, diarrhea

System detects:
⚠️ POTENTIAL OUTBREAK in Barangay Sampinit
Alert Level: CRITICAL
Possible Disease: Classical Swine Fever
```

# Animal Health Risk Assessment ML Feature

## Overview

The Animal Health Risk Assessment is a machine learning feature that predicts health risks for individual animals in the Bago City Veterinary Office system. This feature uses historical data, environmental factors, and health indicators to provide intelligent risk assessments and actionable recommendations.

## Features

### üîç **Intelligent Risk Assessment**
- **Multi-factor Analysis**: Considers health status, weight, vaccination status, environmental conditions, and behavioral changes
- **Seasonal Adjustments**: Applies seasonal disease patterns and risk multipliers
- **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Learns from past assessments to improve accuracy
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence levels for each assessment

### üìä **Risk Levels**
- **Low Risk (0-39%)**: Animals in good health with minimal concerns
- **Medium Risk (40-59%)**: Animals requiring routine monitoring
- **High Risk (60-79%)**: Animals needing immediate attention
- **Critical Risk (80-100%)**: Animals requiring emergency veterinary care

### üéØ **Key Capabilities**
- **Individual Animal Assessment**: Assess specific animals for health risks
- **Bulk Assessment**: Evaluate multiple animals simultaneously
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track risk levels over time
- **Automated Recommendations**: Generate actionable health recommendations
- **Dashboard Integration**: Seamlessly integrated into admin dashboard

## Technical Implementation

### **Machine Learning Algorithm**
The system uses a sophisticated risk assessment algorithm that combines:

1. **Base Risk Calculation**: Starting risk based on current health status
2. **Health Indicator Analysis**: Weight, temperature, vaccination status
3. **Environmental Factor Assessment**: Housing and environmental conditions
4. **Seasonal Pattern Application**: Disease patterns by season and animal type
5. **Historical Trend Analysis**: Learning from past assessments
6. **Final Risk Scoring**: ML-like feature engineering for final score

- `health_indicators`: Tracks health metrics and indicators
- `disease_patterns`: Contains disease patterns and seasonal data
- `ml_model_metrics`: Stores model performance metrics

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET get_health_risk_assessment.php?action=assess&animal_id=X`: Assess specific animal
- `GET get_health_risk_assessment.php?action=summary`: Get risk summary
- `GET get_health_risk_assessment.php?action=high_risk`: Get high-risk animals
- `GET get_health_risk_assessment.php?action=bulk_assess`: Bulk assessment
- `POST get_health_risk_assessment.php?action=add_health_indicator`: Add health indicator

## Installation & Setup

### 1. Database Setup

## Risk Assessment Factors

### **Health Status Factors**
- Current health status (Healthy, Sick, Under Treatment)
- Age-related risk factors
- Weight and body condition
- Vaccination status and history

### **Environmental Factors**
- Housing conditions (Good, Fair, Poor)
- Environmental stress indicators
- Seasonal disease patterns
- Population density effects

### **Behavioral Indicators**
- Changes in behavior or activity
- Appetite and feeding patterns
- Social interaction changes
- Stress indicators

### **Historical Patterns**
- Previous health assessments
- Disease history
- Treatment response patterns
- Seasonal health trends

## Recommendations System

The system generates specific, actionable recommendations based on risk levels:

### **Critical Risk (80-100%)**
- Immediate veterinary examination required
- Isolate animal if showing contagious disease signs
- Monitor closely every 6 hours
- Emergency contact protocols

### **High Risk (60-79%)**
- Schedule veterinary consultation within 24 hours
- Increase monitoring frequency
- Review and improve environmental conditions
- Implement preventive measures

### **Medium Risk (40-59%)**
- Schedule routine health check within 1 week
- Monitor for behavioral or condition changes
- Maintain current health protocols
- Review vaccination schedule

### **Low Risk (0-39%)**
- Continue routine monitoring
- Maintain current health protocols
- Regular health checkups as scheduled
- Preventive care maintenance
